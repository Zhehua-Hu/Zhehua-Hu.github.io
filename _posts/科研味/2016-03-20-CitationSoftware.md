	Ok done it.....
		1. go to https://www.docear.org/software/download/
		2. Download the linux version tar.gz file
		3. Open a terminal
		4. Find the folder where you downloaded the file: for me it was /home/gary/Downloads (cd /home/gary/Downloads)
		5. Unzip the file: gzip -d docear_linux.tar.gz
		6. Untar the file: tar -xvg docear_linux.tar
		7. Go into the docear folder: cd docear-1.0.3.1_stable_build221
		8. Run the script docear.sh. Either type ./docear.sh or sh docear.sh
	That should be it.
	Note that you need Java installed on your machine.
